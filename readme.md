# Differences between Express 4 and Express 5 in Promise Support 

## Express 4
 - In Express 4, handling asynchronous functions (such as Promises) in route handlers required a more explicit approach. Developers had to use a try/catch block to catch any errors that might occur within the asynchronous function and then pass them to the next error-handling middleware.

## Express 5
 - Express 5, on the other hand, simplified the handling of asynchronous functions in route handlers. In Express 5, the try/catch block is no longer necessary, as Express 5 will automatically handle any errors that occur within the asynchronous functions and pass them to the next error-handling middleware.


## Advantages of Express 5's Simplified Promise Support
  - 🌟 Cleaner Code: The elimination of the try/catch block in the route handlers makes the code more concise and easier to read and maintain.
  - 💼 Reduced Boilerplate: Developers no longer need to write additional boilerplate code to handle errors in asynchronous functions.
  - 🔍 Better Error Handling: Express 5 handles the errors more transparently, ensuring that errors are properly propagated to the next error-handling middleware.
  - 📖 Improved Readability: The code in Express 5 route handlers is more focused on the business logic, as the error handling is handled by the framework.
